## Poetry Setup

This project uses Poetry for dependency management. To get started:

1. Install Poetry (if you haven't already):

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
poetry run python manage.py runserver
```

This addition explains the basic Poetry commands needed to get started with the project. It covers installation, dependency management, virtual environment activation, and how to add new packages. Let me know if you'd like me to add any other Poetry-related information!
