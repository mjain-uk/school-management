The project aims to provide modular, scalable, and useful APIs that can be consumed by frontend applications or mobile apps. These APIs will address fundamental issues in school systems, such as:

* **Student Management**
    * Enrollment
    * Attendance tracking
    * Performance evaluation

* **Teacher Management**
    * Assignment of classes
    * Schedules
    * Performance tracking

* **Parent Portal**
    * Communication between parents and school authorities

The primary goal is to create a backend system that simplifies school management processes, ensuring efficiency and user-friendliness.
